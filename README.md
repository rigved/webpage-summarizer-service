Generates summaries of all the provided web pages. This is consumed by the [Mycroft AI Webpage Summarizer Skill](https://github.com/rigved/webpage-summarizer-skill).

## About
This service exposes an API to provide web page URLs and then generates summaries of all the provided web pages. Then, it generates summaries for all the web pages in the queue. Finally, it provides an API to retrieve the generated summaries.

There is a large amount of online news and other interesting articles that we come across every day. It is difficult to keep pace with this large volume of information. This Webpage Summarizer Service and the accompanying [Mycroft AI Webpage Summarizer Skill](https://github.com/rigved/webpage-summarizer-skill) helps to convert all this incoming information into something more manageable.
